I am a second year Ph.D. student at the [Division of Cyber Security](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/research-overview/research-strategy-and-structure/division-of-cyber-security/) at [Abertay University](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Lynsay Shepherd](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/staff-search/dr-lynsay-shepherd/), [Dr. Natalie Coull](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/staff-search/dr-natalie-coull/) and [Mr. Colin McLean](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/staff-search/mr-colin-mclean/).

In my Ph.D. research on attack-aware web applications, I investigate methodologies and techniques to integrate intrusion detection and response capabilities into web applications. 

As part of my research and because of my personal interest, I also explore other research fields such as Web Application Security, Developer-Centered Security, Secure Software Development and Intrusion Detection.
